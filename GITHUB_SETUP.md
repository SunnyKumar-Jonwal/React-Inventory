# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
1. Configure your git user details (if not already done):
   ```powershell
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

## Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `React-Inventory`
3. Description: "Full-stack Inventory Management System with React and Node.js"
4. Set as **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Push to GitHub
After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "c:\Full Stack Projects\React-Inventory"

# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/React-Inventory.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys configured)

# Add remote using SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/React-Inventory.git

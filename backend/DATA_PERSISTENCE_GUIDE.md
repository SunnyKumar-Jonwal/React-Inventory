# Data Persistence Solution

## Problem Fixed ✅
Your products were being deleted on server restart because the `autoSeed.js` function was clearing all data every time.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Smart Auto-Seeding
The `autoSeed.js` now checks if data exists before seeding:
- ✅ **If data exists**: Skips seeding (preserves your products)
- ✅ **If database is empty**: Creates sample data only

### 2. Database Management Commands

```bash
# Check database status
npm run db:check

# Reset database (⚠️ DELETES ALL DATA)
npm run db:reset

# Add sample data (only if empty)
npm run db:seed
```

### 3. Manual Database Management

Use `dbManager.js` for manual control:

```bash
# Check what's in your database
node dbManager.js check

# Reset everything (only use when needed)
node dbManager.js reset

# Add sample data if database is empty
node dbManager.js seed
```

## How It Works Now

### ✅ **Data Persistence**
1. Start server → Checks if data exists
2. **If products exist** → Skips auto-seed, keeps your data
3. **If empty** → Creates default users and sample products
4. Your manually added products are **NEVER DELETED**

### ✅ **Server Restart Behavior**
```
Server Start → Database Check → Decision
     ↓              ↓              ↓
   MongoDB    Has Products?    Skip Seeding
                  ↓               ↓
                 No          Create Samples
                  ↓               ↓
            Empty Database   Default Data
```

## Testing Data Persistence

1. **Add products through your frontend**
2. **Restart the server**
3. **Check if products are still there** ✅

Your data will now persist across server restarts!

## Key Changes Made

### `config/autoSeed.js`
- Added checks for existing users, products, and sales
- Only seeds if database is completely empty
- Preserves all existing data

### `dbManager.js` (New)
- Provides manual database control
- Safe reset functionality
- Database status checking

### `package.json`
- Added database management scripts
- Easy commands for database operations

## Usage Examples

### Normal Development
```bash
npm start  # Data persists automatically
```

### When You Need Fresh Data
```bash
npm run db:reset  # Resets and adds sample data
npm start         # Start with fresh data
```

### Check Your Data
```bash
npm run db:check  # Shows how many users/products/sales
```

Your inventory data is now **permanent** and will survive server restarts! 🎉
